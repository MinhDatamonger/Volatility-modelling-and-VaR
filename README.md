This repo is a group project (with coauthor Tudor Ungureanu) from my studies on estimating volatility of Intel stock (INTC) and its Value at Risk forecast. The project consists of 1) univariate volatility modelling of INTC stock with AR-GARCH, and 2) multivariate volatility modelling (of INTC together with Dow Jones Industrial Average Index) with  Dynamic Conditional Correlation (DCC) and Baba-Engle-Kraft-Kroner (BEKK) models. The code for univariate volatility is found in "Univariate-Volatility-VaR.ipynb" file and the report on its results is in "Report-univariate-volatility.pdf". The code for multivariate volatility is found in "Multivariate-Volatility.ipynb" and its report in "Report-Multivariate-Volatility.pdf".
